# Archived Documentation

This folder contains superseded documentation kept for historical reference.

## Why Archive?

These documents were consolidated into:
- `docs/PRD_PROJECT_REVIEW_AND_ROADMAP.md` - Current state and roadmap
- `docs/FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Detailed feature specs
- `docs/CONSOLIDATED_DOCS.md` - Overview and quick reference

## Archived Files

Move the following files here if they exist at the project root:
- `bug-fix.md`
- `implementation-plan.md`
- `implementation-checklist.md`

## Note

Do not modify archived documents. If updates are needed, make them in the active documentation.
